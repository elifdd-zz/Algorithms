PURPOSE:
JAVA programming language is used as the programming language
This project aims to implement finding a weighted median algorithm in O(n) time.
Methods RANDOMIZED-SELECT, RANDOMIZED-PARTITION and PARTITION is implemented with the given
algorithms in Cormen.

PERCENT COMPLETE:
I believe I have accomplished to meet all the requirements given in the project description.
I have tested the the algorithm with all the inputs given in the results.doc file which is
posted to the blackboard for this project.

BUGS:
All the exceptions has tried to be handled.


FILES:
InputFileReader.java			reads the input file creates the list
Node.java						a list element
MedianDriver.java				the file contains the main function
WeightedMedianComputer.java		java file implements the algorithms

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

This is a sample input generated from the file  input.txt 

10 , 20
8 , 1
4 , 1
16 , 1
2 , 1

Regular Median Key: 8
Regular Median: 8 stored at the index: 3
Sum Left: 3.0
Sum Right: 23.0
Sum Half: 13.5
Regular Median: 12 stored at the index: 6
Sum Left: 20.0
Sum Right: 2.0
Sum Half: 13.5
Regular Median: 10 stored at the index: 5
Weighted Median Key: 10 at index: 5
2 , 1
4 , 1

This program has also been tested in bingsuns for these outputs and nothing has gone wrong.
Running the program in bingsuns still provides desired output.


TO COMPILE:
Go to directory of your file from command line and type:

javac Submission.java

or 

make

TO RUN:
After compiling stay in the same directory and type:

java Submission <input file name>
