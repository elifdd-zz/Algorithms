PURPOSE:
This project aims to implement an extended heap.

PERCENT COMPLETE:
I believe I have accomplished to meet all the requirements given in the project description.

BUGS:
All the exceptions has tried to be handled.
One important point is that the input and output files should be in the same directory with the project.
And the input file contents should be exactly in the same format with the given file "input.txt"  

FILES:
HandleItem.java				the java file determining the handle node type
HeapItem.java				the java file determining the heap node type
Heap.java					where the heap is implemented
HeapFileReader.java			reads the input file at once and creates the operation list
HeapOutputFileWriter.java	writes the output list to a file at the end of the program
Operation.java				the java file determining the operation prototype
OperationExecuter.java		executes all the operations in the operation list
HeapRunner.java				the file contains the main function

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

This is a sample from the output.txt that is generated for the operations in the input.txt

insert 1 0
find 1
1 is not in the extended heap
inserted 1 with priority 0
insert 2 15
find 2
2 is not in the extended heap
inserted 2 with priority 15
insert 3 80
find 3
3 is not in the extended heap
inserted 3 with priority 80
insert 4 20
find 4
4 is not in the extended heap
inserted 4 with priority 20
print extended heap
node 0 = 1 0
node 1 = 2 15
node 2 = 3 80
node 3 = 4 20
find 5
5 is not in the extended heap
deleteMin
deleted 1 with the priority 0
change priority 3 40
find 3
3 has the priority 80
changed priority of 3 to 40
change priority 4 14
find 4
4 has the priority 20
changed priority of 4 to 14
print extended heap
node 0 = 4 14
node 1 = 2 15
node 2 = 3 40

 

TO COMPILE:
Go to directory of your file from command line and type:

javac HeapRunner.java

TO RUN:
After compiling stay in the same directory and type:

java HeapRunner <input file name> <output file name>

EXTRA CREDIT:
There were no extra credit offered for this assignment
