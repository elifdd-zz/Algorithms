PURPOSE:
This project aims to implement towers of Hanoi. Output file contains the call time and number of calls
information for each value of #disks input. However, if the number of disks is less than 6 it also prints
the steps of each call into the output file and to the screen.

I have used java BigInteger as the type of number of calls variable to prevent the overflow in 32 machines 


PERCENT COMPLETE:
I believe I have accomplished to meet all the requirements given in the project description.
I have tested the the algorithm with many values and it seems perfectly working

BUGS:
All the exceptions has tried to be handled.


FILES:
OutputFileWriter.java		writes the output list to a file at the end of the program
Towers.java					the java file implements the towers of hanoi algorithm
HanoiTowerBuilder.java		the file contains the main function

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

This is a sample from the output.txt that is generated for 4 Disks;

Disk 1: Move from S to I
Disk 2: Move from S to D
Disk 1: Move from I to D
Disk 3: Move from S to I
Disk 1: Move from D to S
Disk 2: Move from D to I
Disk 1: Move from S to I
Disk 4: Move from S to D
Disk 1: Move from I to D
Disk 2: Move from I to S
Disk 1: Move from D to S
Disk 3: Move from I to D
Disk 1: Move from S to I
Disk 2: Move from S to D
Disk 1: Move from I to D
The current number of disks is 4
The number of recursive calls was 31 and the time was 1

------------------------------------------------------------
This is a sample output for the program run for 30 disks:

The current number of disks is 30
The number of recursive calls was 2147483647 and the time was 195395


-------------------------------------------------------------
This is a sample output for the program run for 31 disks:

The current number of disks is 31
The number of recursive calls was 4294967295 and the time was 380057

This program has also been tested in bingsuns for these outputs and nothing has gone wrong.
Running the program in bingsuns still provides desired output.



TO COMPILE:
Go to directory of your file from command line and type:

javac HanoiTowerBuilder.java

TO RUN:
After compiling stay in the same directory and type:

java HanoiTowerBuilder <number of disks> <output file name>

EXTRA CREDIT:
There were no extra credit offered for this assignment
